# Matrix-flip mini game

## Overview
### This is a mini game based on a problem I solved on the HackerRank platform. To create it, I used the React knowledge I got on the Full Stack open course Part 1. While making this project, I focused on creating **React components** that get the required values using **props**, and using the React **useState** hook.
